# Connect4 with Artificial Intelligence
Example of MinMax Algorithm to implement a game.

The project was developed through NetBeans IDE.

## Game mode
In this application, the user plays against the computer through the console indicating the turn of the players. I also included color to identify the "X" or "O" in the board.

The game finishes when one of the players made a 4-row, 4-column or 4-diagonal. Enjoy it !
